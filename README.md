Fantasy Football League Commissioner

Hello, I'm Connor Daly. I am going to be going through the steps in which a fantasy football commissioner (myself) starts, plans and runs a fantasy football league! A fantasy football commissioner is responsible for everything in the league, including organizing the draft date and time, setting league rules, deciding on trades, organizing league activities, punishing the last place team and so much more! I hope you enjoy my guide!
